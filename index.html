        <!-- Results -->
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Results</h3>
        <p>The goal of tuition is to make significant progress with your pupil, wherever their starting point is.
            The mark of a good teacher is how much progress a pupil makes in comparison to the expected progress for
            their age and ability. This is often measured by comparing a pupil's exam results with their expected
            grades that they receive when entering secondary school.</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li><i class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow text-primary me-2 fs-5"></i>GCSE pupils that took my class achieved
                <strong>2.42 grades higher</strong> than they would have with an average UK teacher.
            </li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow text-primary me-2 fs-5"></i><strong>89%</strong> of my A-level students
                have received <strong>A*-B</strong>, and none have failed.</li>
            <li><i class="bi bi-graph-up-arrow text-primary me-2 fs-5"></i>In the 2022-2023 private tutoring cohort, all
                of my GCSE or A-Level students that were with me for more than 8 sessions were on or above target
                grade, with some students achieving up to <strong>2 grades higher</strong> at A-Level.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These results include pupils with Special Education Needs and Disabilities, pupils with English as an
            additional language, pupils with mental health, emotional and social needs, gifted and talented
            pupils/high ability pupils, and pupils who find it difficult to adapt their way of thinking and
            behaviour to conventional education settings.</p>

        <!-- Head of Geography and Curriculum Writing -->
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Head of Geography and Curriculum Writing</h3>
        <p>In my time as Head of Geography, I made a culture of progress the top priority in my department. The
            resources and routines I developed to do this will be accessible to and tailored to your child's needs.
            In my time in this role, I also trained other teachers in the beginning years. I have also been employed
            in the private sector (Bromsgrove School) to plan and deliver revision intensive courses to ensure
            short-term progress before the exam season.</p>
        <p>I can offer personalised schemes of work for homeschooled students using my experience; an Ofsted
            inspector during a 'deep-dive' has recently graded the 7-year curriculum overhaul in Geography in my
            former department as 'phenomenal'.</p>

        <!-- Lead Assessment Writer -->
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Lead Assessment Writer, Published Resources Authoring Experience, and Examiner Training
        </h3>
        <p>I work with outside agencies to create and deliver exam revision content and have presented both in
            online and in-person workshops nationwide. I have also written published content guides on answering
            exam questions at A-level. As well as training and experience as an examiner, I am also a Lead
            Assessment Writer for a major exam board writing the exam paper and mark scheme.</p>

        <!-- Education -->
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Education</h3>
        <p>I hold a 2:1 BSc (Hons) in Geography from the University of Nottingham and studied a range of Geography
            topics and a PGCE (with Merit) also from the University of Nottingham. Previously I attended Bexley
            Grammar School in London, studying A-levels in Geography, English Literature, Drama and Theatre Studies,
            and Biology whilst voluntarily opting to study a GCSE in Geology to satisfy personal interest.</p>
        <p>In the year following University, I worked as an au-pair teaching English in Italy, travelled South
            Africa, and worked as a nanny and tutor in Central London. Throughout University and school, I worked as
            a swimming teacher and coach for 2 to 18-year-olds.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 fw-semibold">My Tutoring Approach</h2>
        <p>Coaching, questioning, and effective modelling and feedback, as well as metacognition (how to help pupils
            transmit their knowledge and understanding across tasks and contexts, and linking prior learning to be
            successful in future learning) and study skills throughout the process, are the strengths to my teaching
            and to success for your child. In this current climate (and with the right educator with the right
            tools), online sessions can be as equally effective as in-person sessions. I do not have a preference
            either way as different methods suit different children and parent/guardian contexts.</p>
        <p>Quality Geography education is more important than ever. The increased pressure on children to excel
            equally in these subjects, and with the additional context of the pandemic, may mean that they require
            additional support. I would be happy to supply friendly, creative, and dynamic 1-1 or group tutoring
            time to build their confidence and academic success. Homework, grading/feedback, and assessments can be
            included in your tutoring plan if that suits your needs.</p>
        <p>I believe that my fresh and successful teaching knowledge, experience with a wide variety of learning
            needs and difficulties, and expansive and effective resources will allow us to arrange the experience
            that best suits your needs.</p>
        <p>Editable Personal Learning Checklists (PLCs), glossaries, and personalised homework available for each

                            to self study. Fiona is really knowledgeable about not only her subject but the exam
                            techniques to reach full potential.

                            My son really looks forward to each geography GCSE tutoring session with Fiona and I think
                            the best feedback I could give is that he has started keeping notes of questions to ask
                            Fiona in next sessions when he’s not quite sure of a topic in school. True testament to how
                            approachable and passionate she is. Thank you so much Fiona for helping coax a reluctant
                            learner out of his shell!"</p>
