        <p>The goal of tuition is to make significant progress with your pupil, wherever their starting point is.
            The mark of a good teacher is how much progress a pupil makes in comparison to the expected progress for
            their age and ability. This is often measured by comparing a pupil's exam results with their expected
            grades that they receive when entering secondary school.</p>

        <!-- Head of Geography and Curriculum Writing -->
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Head of Geography and Curriculum Writing</h3>
        <p>In my time as Head of Geography, I made a culture of progress the top priority in my department. The
            resources and routines I developed to do this will be accessible to and tailored to your child's needs.
            In my time in this role, I also trained other teachers in the beginning years. I have also been employed
            in the private sector (Bromsgrove School) to plan and deliver revision intensive courses to ensure
            short-term progress before the exam season.</p>
        <p>I can offer personalised schemes of work for homeschooled students using my experience; an Ofsted
            inspector during a 'deep-dive' has recently graded the 7-year curriculum overhaul in Geography in my
            former department as 'phenomenal'.</p>

        <!-- Lead Assessment Writer -->
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Lead Assessment Writer, Published Resources Authoring Experience, and Examiner Training
        </h3>
        <p>I work with outside agencies to create and deliver exam revision content and have presented both in
            online and in-person workshops nationwide. I have also written published content guides on answering
            exam questions at A-level. As well as training and experience as an examiner, I am also a Lead
            Assessment Writer for a major exam board writing the exam paper and mark scheme.</p>

        <!-- Education -->
        <h3 class="fw-semibold">Education</h3>
        <p>I hold a 2:1 BSc (Hons) in Geography from the University of Nottingham and studied a range of Geography
            topics and a PGCE (with Merit) also from the University of Nottingham. Previously I attended Bexley
            Grammar School in London, studying A-levels in Geography, English Literature, Drama and Theatre Studies,
            and Biology whilst voluntarily opting to study a GCSE in Geology to satisfy personal interest.</p>
        <p>In the year following University, I worked as an au-pair teaching English in Italy, travelled South
            Africa, and worked as a nanny and tutor in Central London. Throughout University and school, I worked as
            a swimming teacher and coach for 2 to 18-year-olds.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-3 fw-semibold">My Tutoring Approach</h2>
        <p>Coaching, questioning, and effective modelling and feedback, as well as metacognition (how to help pupils
            transmit their knowledge and understanding across tasks and contexts, and linking prior learning to be
            successful in future learning) and study skills throughout the process, are the strengths to my teaching
            and to success for your child. In this current climate (and with the right educator with the right
            tools), online sessions can be as equally effective as in-person sessions. I do not have a preference
            either way as different methods suit different children and parent/guardian contexts.</p>
        <p>Quality Geography education is more important than ever. The increased pressure on children to excel
            equally in these subjects, and with the additional context of the pandemic, may mean that they require
            additional support. I would be happy to supply friendly, creative, and dynamic 1-1 or group tutoring
            time to build their confidence and academic success. Homework, grading/feedback, and assessments can be
            included in your tutoring plan if that suits your needs.</p>
        <p>I believe that my fresh and successful teaching knowledge, experience with a wide variety of learning
            needs and difficulties, and expansive and effective resources will allow us to arrange the experience
            that best suits your needs.</p>
        <p>Editable Personal Learning Checklists (PLCs), glossaries, and personalised homework available for each
            student.</p>

                            have seen fantastic results already both in tests set within his school and his confidence
                            to self study. Fiona is really knowledgeable about not only her subject but the exam
                            techniques to reach full potential. My son really looks forward to each geography GCSE
                            tutoring session with Fiona and I think
                            the best feedback I could give is that he has started keeping notes of questions to ask
                            Fiona in next sessions when he’s not quite sure of a topic in school. True testament to how
                            approachable and passionate she is. Thank you so much Fiona for helping coax a reluctant
                            learner out of his shell!"</p>

                            She is a fantastic tutor and would strongly recommend to anyone. She has a very clear and
                            concise way of teaching and it is clear that a significant amount of effort goes into both
                            lesson prep and setting work to do outside of lessons. Her extremely in-depth understanding
                            of the subject and the exams shines through in the lessons, and she is effective at honing
                            in on any areas where your exam technique may be lacking. I would have struggled massively
                            without her help, and I strongly recommend Fiona to anyone considering geography tutoring,
                            especially if you are taking AQA, however, I don't doubt that she is also extremely
                            knowledgeable about the other exam boards as well."</p>

                            in-depth understanding of the curriculum and the exam requirements for GSCE. The preparation

                            requirements and learning style. In preparation for the exams Fiona has literally covered
                            every conceivable way in which a question might be asked on a sub topic and coached on how
                            to answer for maximum marks. Our sons lessons have been intense and much has needed to be
                            covered but Fiona has not been daunted and she has managed to keep our Son engaged and been
                            nothing but encouraging to a teenager who was disenchanted with the subject. Fiona provides
                            feedback on progress to us and has given our Son every opportunity to succeed. Our Son finds
                            Fiona easy to talk to and she has such a clear and concise way of communicating the subject
                            matter. A truly fortunate find and we highly recommend her to any parent…… we just wish we’d
